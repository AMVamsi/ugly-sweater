You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you.

But is it okay we have you in the video? Like we were just filming all that.\n","Banned for watching movies in the corner with the dunces.\n"," I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\n","Banned for taking all the room under my bed.

Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. And I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. And after all this time, I'm into you. Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, how I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV. Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it.

So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\n","\n","All things in moderation.  Sims is indeed a video game, and a good one at that.

But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\n"," Hey guys, I'm James Montgomery. Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.\n"," I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

How could you! Think of the B!\n","\n"," I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV. Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful.

You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds.

But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.\n"," I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\n"," Hey guys, I'm James Montgomery. Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV.

It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world.

I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to.

It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else.

Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\n","enfp and intj moments    sportscenter not top ten plays    pranks Oh stop stop! Why?

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it.

We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful.

Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.\n"," I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game.

Think of the B!\n"," I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game.

I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\n","enfp and intj moments    sportscenter not top ten plays    pranks Oh stop stop! Why?

Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds.

We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful.

You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. And I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. And after all this time, I'm into you. Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist.

Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV. Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. And I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"I like this person's mentality.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here.

So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that.

Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV. Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"I like this person's mentality.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","['']\n","[\"enfp and intj moments    sportscenter not top ten plays    pranks Oh stop stop! Why? Why? Oh. Why do so many people want me so early? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV. Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you.\"]\n","['It appears to be too late. :sad:']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"I like this person's mentality.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Think of the B!\"]\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"Banned for too many b's in that sentence. How could you!

When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"Ahh... old high school music I haven't heard in ages.

I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

Yeah, you know what the library is? Yeah. Okay. And the library just depends on the section. This will put you on the library. Awesome. Thank you. Oh, okay. Alright. Alright, thanks for watching. Thanks for subscribing and be sure to show your friends. Hey, I'm going to be in the library. Yeah, we're actually... My friend and I were trying to make a video about how handshakes can be awkward sometimes. Right. So you just... You know like the fist bump and yeah like I don't know, it's the confusion about that. But is it okay we have you in the video? Like we were just filming all that.\"]\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"' [♪ tails paper and triggers the past\"]\n","['']\n","[\"enfp and intj moments    sportscenter not top ten plays    pranks Oh stop stop! Why? Why? Oh.

Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. And I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game.

And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

I thought confidence was a good thing.']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy.

I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it.

Welcome to Paramore Live from MTV. Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. And I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. And after all this time, I'm into you. Baby, not a day goes by that I'm not into you. I should be over all the butterflies, now I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, how I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you.

He's a confirmed INTJ by the way. \"]\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man.

Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"I failed a public speaking class a few years ago and I've sort of learned what I could do better were I to be in that position again.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds.

When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","['84389  84390     ...']\n","[\"enfp and intj moments    sportscenter not top ten plays    pranks Oh stop stop! Why? Why? Oh. Why do so many people want me so early? Why? Why? Why? Why?

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"I failed a public speaking class a few years ago and I've sort of learned what I could do better were I to be in that position again.

It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

But is it okay we have you in the video? Like we were just filming all that.\"]\n","['Banned for watching movies in the corner with the dunces.']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

Right now I'm in the MTV Roozeroo newsroom, but come with me because we're going into the studio. We're going to be hanging with your favorite band as they gear up to release their brand new album. It's in stores tomorrow. I'll be talking to them all about the making of it. They'll also be taking your questions on Twitter. The hashtag is Ask Paramore. But first, I guess, performing a pair of songs, one is their brand new single, Still Into You and the second is an old favorite, ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Paramore. Let's go to Still Into You. Can't count the ears on one hand if we've been together. That's right. I need the other one to hold you, make you feel, make you feel better. It's not a walk in the park to love each other, but when nothing goes into luck, can't deny, can't deny you with it. Because after all this time, I'm still into you. It's not beautiful. I should be over all the butterflies, and I'm into you. And baby, I know our stars, I'm into you. Let them wonder how we got this far. The sun don't really need to warn you at all. Yeah, after all this time, I'm still into you. Woo! Recompimate the night that first met your mother. And on the drive-out to my house, I told you that, I told you that, I love you. You filled the weight of the world, fall off, you shoulder. And through your favorite song, we sang along into the start of forever. And after all this time, I'm still into you.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"Yo entp ladies... if you're into a complimentary personality,well, hey.\"]\n","['Banned because this thread requires it of me.']\n","['Get high in backyard, roast and eat marshmellows in backyard while conversing over something intellectual, followed by massages and kisses.']\n","['']\n","['']\n","[\"Hello ENFJ7.

That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously.

You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it. I mean, what kind of player do you want to be? You'll be the kind of player that when you're gone, people are like, damn, and I miss him. He was awesome player. I wish he was back where I played with me some more. Are you going to be the kind of player that people are like, damn, I'm glad that motherfucker is gone. That guy's like, dickhead. I don't ever want to play with that guy again. Oh no, I don't be the kind of guy that he want to play with again. And not only that, but being a decent human being actually benefits you. I mean, the more people you're nice to, the more love you get back. And that makes the game so much more enjoyable. The more people you're assholes to and treat like shit, the more shit you get back. It's not karma. Any bullshit like that. It's just human nature. If you're nice to people, they're more likely to be nice to you. For me to, they're more likely to be mean to you. That's just the way things are. And not only that, but there's also consequences to your action. They're laws of this game. They're rules. And if you break those rules, they can make your experience here very negative. So you want to stay within the boundaries of those rules in order not to have a terrible experience in this game. So look people, start living your life like it's a fucking game. I highly recommend it. Don't fucking be held back by these concepts like sin and shit that doesn't exist. Fuck whoever you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck you want as long as you're hurting anybody else. Do whatever drugs you want as long as you're not fucking hurting anybody else. Do whatever the fuck makes you happy. It's your game, play it like you fucking want to. Don't let anybody else trick you into playing by their rules. Make up your own rules. Enjoy that shit. Soak it up because unfortunately, as far as I know, this game has perma death in it. What's your dad? You're fucking dad. There's no more gameplay for you. So soak that shit up while you can and do it that shit while you can. Play it to the best of your ability while you can. And thank all of you for letting me play this game with you. I'm enjoying the shout of it. Seriously. Logic.\"]\n","[\"Ahh... old high school music I haven't heard in ages.

Ya gotta learn to share with the roaches.']\n","[\" I don't want to freak you guys out, but you are a robot and life is probably a fucking video game. You might be saying, what the fuck are you talking about? When you ever heard a simulation theory, if not, you should look this shit up, man. Sam Harris has been talking about this a lot. And I've looked into it and this fucking shit is fascinating. It basically works on a couple of assumptions. The first assumption is this. Eventually, a society, whether it's our society or an alien society, doesn't really matter. Or eventually, a society where we reach the level of technology where they can simulate worlds that just are own. And it seems pretty safe to assume this will eventually happen. I mean, just think of our technologies from 50 years ago. We have handheld computers today that are billions of times more powerful and millions of times smaller than those computers were back then. So just think about what our technology will be like a thousand years from now or a hundred thousand or a million or a billion. If you don't destroy ourselves by then, there's no telling what kind of technology we'll have. So there's a pretty safe assumption that eventually some society will figure this shit out. Well, they will be able to simulate worlds. And once that happens, man. They won't do it just once. Of course, they won't do that. They'll have the power they can simulate many worlds. For any one-man world, that can be thousands or millions of simulated worlds. And who knows? Maybe those simulated worlds will themselves eventually reach the level of technology where they too can simulate worlds. So there can be billions or trillions or uncalable numbers of simulated worlds for every one-man world. Which means mathematically, it is much more likely that we are one of the simulations than it is that we are one of the main worlds. And maybe it's the weed talking man. But that makes complete sense to me. I fucking get that shit. But I actually have something I like to add to that. For every one big world that they simulate, they're actually going to do lots of smaller simulations. So for every one large simulation, like a simulation of entire world or universe, there will be many, many, many more smaller simulations, which the few people are just one person like a video game. And it's much, much, much more likely that you're in one of these video games that it is that you're inside one of these simulated worlds. And much less than one of the fucking main worlds. Life is probably a fucking video game man. That's what they explain so much. If you ever fucking look around the world, thought this is not normal. Something he is up here. That's on board shit going on here. This is way too fucking bizarre to take seriously. Yeah, it's because of video games. Like whoever made this game was aiming for a dark comedy, and they succeeded like a motherfucker with that shit. That's exactly what this is. Life is a dark comedy. And I'm not saying that life is definitely a video game. My life is definitely a video game. I mean, you stink about it. So I started kind of living my life like a video game man. I kind of think of myself as a video game character. And just because you live your life like a video game, doesn't mean you have to be a total dickhead about it.
